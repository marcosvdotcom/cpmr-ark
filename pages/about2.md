## Native Flintknappers Online

Flintknapping has a complicated presence on the internet, perhaps especially for those uninitiated into the topic. On the positive side, Native and Indigenous cultural heritage experts around the globe are using the advent of digital media to share their flintknapping perspectives and practices on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, and Instagram reels. On the negative side, social media marketplaces like Facebook marketplace can supercharge the ease with which illegally or unethically sourced points, tools, and stones can be sold and traded.

[Noel Grayson](https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/flintknapping-cherokee-noel-grayson-video), Cherokee, is a great example of how digital storytelling can be part of culture keeping. Noel is an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, and was given the honorary title of Cherokee National Treasure in 1998, a special honor reserved for artisans and culture keepers. Grayson has created a number of videos showcasing his flintknapping practice, and explaining flintknapping facts and cultural contexts, like how tools will be used once they’re made.

*Grayson demonstrates flintknapping and discusses flintknapping’s history and context, especially for Cherokee people.*

Other Indigenous creators are using platforms like TikTok or Instagram to showcase their flintknapping practice, as well as sharing cultural knowledges and contexts. Chumash artist [Steve Kulupeč Saffold](
https://www.instagram.com/truetotradition/reel/C6PXIOhSUqh/), who has an instagram handle under “truetotradition”, which has almost 50k followers, is a great example.  Saffold showcases beautiful bifaces, projectile points, and other creations he makes by flintknapping and other traditional arts practices.

## Further Reading on Respecting Cultural Heritage While Flintknapping
<p>

>IE: What do you want archaeologists and collectors to know to move collaborative practice forward? 

<br>

>ADK: Everyone collecting artifacts, whether as an archaeologist or a collector, should treat artifacts with respect as potentially sacred items. Think about why they were left behind. What were the social and political contexts during loss or that caused the artifact to be left behind? Recognize that abandonment of some stuff maybe was not the choice of the people but was forced by circumstances or pressures on them. Remember that these artifacts belonged to someone else from another time and had importance in their lives. It would be better if collectors recorded where they found things but left them alone.

From: [“Some Indigenous Perspectives on Artifact Collecting and Archaeologist–Collector Collaboration”](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/some-indigenous-perspectives-on-artifact-collecting-and-archaeologistcollector-collaboration/67A777A3B41ACAF67152A07D874DEB26)

<p>

>“Existing federal statutes and international treaties are woefully incomplete and often ineffective at preventing the escalation of looting on Indian reservations, public or private lands, and they are completely inadequate when it comes to halting private land foraging. Diggers on private lands need only the landowner’s permission. Sacred items and even the remains of ancestors and their burial belongings continue to be sold in the “art” market, without any notification of the affected tribes. Auctioneers and traders of “antique” Indian art claim that they need tribes to furnish lists of what constitutes their sacred items. Otherwise, we are told, these dealers have no way of knowing how to make such determinations on their own. This is both specious and disingenuous. The high market value the collectors place on these items is indicative of their special attributes of spirituality. Traders cannot claim ignorance and, at the same time, benefit from the “perception” of sacredness.”

[“Trading in Native artifacts does real harm”](https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-justice-trading-in-native-artifacts-does-real-harm/)
<p>

>“Finding high-quality rock for making points became an obsession, too. Over the years, I have hauled in a massive quantity of rock! There are some ethics to harvesting good flaking rock so that the archaeological record isn’t damaged or contaminated—we don’t want to create new sites. Moreover, flintknapping should never be done on or near sites. Most places with high-quality flaking stone today were also used in the past, and are covered with artifacts from the quarrying process. Collecting material people used and discarded in the past, or striking flakes into such materials, destroys the archaeological record. So, I collect in rivers and washes that have exposed new, unworked material. I test cobbles in washes or rivers that have no context, as everything is washed away when it floods.”

(“My Flintknapping Problem”)[https://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/2015/12/17/my-flintknapping-problem/]
<p>

>“So…Can I Pick up the Arrowhead? The short answer: you can pick it up, take pictures of it, and take a waypoint to share with an archaeologist, but you can’t take it home with you, especially if you’re like me and mostly hunt on state- or federally-owned lands. Rock art, whether painted or incised, should never be touched; the oils from our hands can damage the panel both instantly and over time.”

<h3>“My whole life was around my politics, my schoolwork and being a student was secondary.”</h3>
<p>Born: Sonora Mexico	</p>
<p>Education: San Diego State</p>	


<p>Sonia Lopez was born in Sonora, Mexico. She immigrated at a young age to the United States, moving to Imperial Valley before settling in Calexico, a border town in California.</p>

<p>Lopez had a difficult childhood. Poverty controlled her life; her family didn’t have indoor plumbing, and in her interview, she struggles to hold back tears as she describes how it felt to come to school wearing other student’s hand-me-downs. Lopez’s father, an alcoholic, worked as a mechanic for farm machinery; her mother worked at local stores. With both parents out of the house, much of the housework and childcare fell on Lopez’s shoulders.</p>

<p>However, Lopez cites these difficulties as catalyst for change. In her interview, she says, “Living in poverty and knowing how much it hurts motivated me to say, I don’t want to be poor” (9:54). Because she wanted to escape poverty, Lopez worked hard to graduate from high school. Then, while most of her friends dreamed about getting married, Lopez set her sights on college. She attended community college before going to San Diego State through the Equal Opportunities Program in 1968.</p>

<p>It was in college that Lopez began to get involved with activism. College was a culture shock; she experienced stereotyping, and felt isolated and alone on campus. Joining MEChA completely changed her experience. She became, in her own words, a “political animal,” attending meetings all day, traveling across the state, and developing a Chicano Studies program. While involved with MEChA, Lopez became frustrated with the strict gender roles within the organization. Women were tasked with traditionally female jobs, like answering phones and cooking for the male members, all while being subjected to men’s predatory advances. While being a “feminist” had negative connotations, Lopez and her friends began to fight against these traditional gender roles; as Lopez says, “We were becoming feminists but not saying that we were becoming feminists” (2:37).</p>

<p>Lopez’s political involvement opened doors, but it also limited her ability to be a student. In 1970, she left San Diego State, putting schoolwork secondary to politics, and traveled around the country advocating for Chicana/o rights with figures like Corky Gonzalez, Reyes Lopez Tijerina, both of whom she openly challenged about sexist remarks. She later went to Sacramento to finish her coursework. When she finished school, Lopez returned to Calexico to help with a brother who was struggling with addiction, and remained in Calexico for several years, working as a counselor in the high school and as a campaign manager for a friend in 1975.</p>

<p>Lopez went on to teach as a professor, first at San Diego State, and then at Fullerton State. She also attended law school. Through studying law, Lopez became passionate about immigration reform, and began to work with undocumented youth. She remains active in Chicana/o rights, and acknowledges the positive social change she and other women have created. Lopez wants her experiences to help tell the story of many women who, forgotten by history, made a real difference in the Chicana/o movement.&nbsp;</p>

The expulsion presents itself as blacklisting, underfunding, and exclusion from leadership, (certainly from spaces of power and agency) or, in some instances as access to membership with agency within organizations.
